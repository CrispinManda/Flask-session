The issue you're running into is because you're on Windows, and the path you're using:

bash

source venv/bin/activate
is for Linux/MacOS. On Windows, you should activate your virtual environment like this:

For Git Bash or PowerShell:
bash

source venv/Scripts/activate
or

bash

. venv/Scripts/activate
For Command Prompt (CMD):
cmd

venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Once activated, you should see (venv) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.
